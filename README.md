# Factory Design Automation

In this project we study techniques to reduce the effort of factory design tasks.
To achieve this goal, we develop an easy-to-use configurator and simulator for a particular class of factories.
More precisely, we concentrate on flexible manufacturing systems, which can be adapted to a variety of products and processes easily.
We assume that the material flow between the work stations is handled completely by gantry robots.

## Screenshots

Here are some screenshots of our prototypes:

### üñºÔ∏è Simulator

We provide a discrete event simulator with 3D visualization capabilities.

### üñºÔ∏è Visualizer

We also provide a visualization of the possible products and processes.

### üñºÔ∏è Editor

Finally, we provide a basic editor for changing your factory layout.

## Models

Here are some models explaining our overall idea:

### üìà Class model

The class model describes the entities of factory design:

### üìà Object model

The object model describes an example factory design:
