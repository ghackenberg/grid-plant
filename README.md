# Factory Design Automation

In this project we study techniques for reducing the effort of modeling and analyzing factory layouts.
To achieve this goal, we develop an easy-to-use configurator and simulator for a particular class of factories.
More precisely, we concentrate on flexible manufacturing systems, which can be adapted to a variety of products and processes.
We assume that the material flow between the work stations of the factory is handled completely by gantry robots.

## Requirements

To use this project, you need to install the following software packages on your machine.
Note that simulation experiments can be carried out without the optional software packages.

* Python
* *Discrete event simulation support*
  * Salabim
  * *3D animation support (optional)*
    * PyOpenGL
    * PyOpenGL_accelerate
  * *OBJ Wavefront file format support (optional)*
    * PyWavefront
    * PyGlet
  * *Video production support (optional)*
    * opencv-python
    * numpy
* *Graph visualization support (optional)*
  * NetworkX
  * Matplotlib

## Screenshots

Here are some screenshots of our prototypes:

### üñºÔ∏è Simulator

We provide a discrete event simulator with 3D visualization capabilities.

### üñºÔ∏è Visualizer

We also provide a visualization of the possible products and processes.

## Models

Here are some models explaining our overall idea:

### üìà Class model

The class model describes the entities of factory design:

### üìà Object model

The object model describes an example factory design:

#### Object model 1
